# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

## Introduction
In this page I shall present some of the machine learning projects I have undertaken to learn new machine learning concepts as well as to showcase my skills.  which I have undertaken as a hobby. My ultimate motive would be to learn and gain expertise over several Machine Learning and data science concepts.

## ABOUT ME
I am a double master's graduate in engineering and an alumni of Washington State University, Nanyang Technological University and Indian Institute of Technology. In order to showcase my data science skills and a deep passion towards Data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence,  I have undertaken several machine learning projects and would like to share my work.

## Machine Learning Projects
In order to showcase diverse machine learning concepts, I have done following machine learning projects which emphasize on anomaly detection, natural language processing and other machine learning concepts 

### 1.Credit Card Fraud Detection
The dataset for this project was taken from a Kaggle project. 
In this project, an anomaly detection algorithm has been modelled using Isolation forest and Local Outlier Factor algorithms in order to precisely identify the fradulent credit card transactions. A model with precision of about 39% has been realized  using the Isolation Forest algorithm. Further, improvements to the model would be updated.

### 2.Sentiment Analysis using NLP with Spacy and SVM
Natural Language  Processing was used on the dataset obtained online containing labelled (positive or negative) reviews for various items in Yelp, Amazon and IMDB.
In this project, spacy package was used to clean, tokenize, lemmatize and filter the textual data of any stopwords/ punctuations/ pronouns. Further, Count Vectorizor was used to vectorize the cleaned data and Support Vector Machine classifier has been used to classify the data and predict if the review is positive or negative. A pipeline was been created where the split data was cleaned, vectorized and classified. It was observed that the SVM classifier has produced a model which has an accuracy of upto 76 %.

### 3.Board Game Review Prediction
This project was conducted as an extension of a udemy course where the dataset was provided for numerous board games and their metrics and ratings and a supervised regression learning model such as linear regression and random forest regression algorithms were trained to predict the board game ratings with mean squared error as low as 1.6 was observed
